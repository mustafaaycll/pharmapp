## Notes Regarding the Code
State management is done with `StreamBuilder<Object>`. Functions used to flow data are defined in `lib/services`. `auth.dart` contains sign-in methods and Firestore Storage upload functions, while `database.dart` containing 7 different classes:

`DatabaseServices`: Functions related to user information flows and updates

`DatabaseServices_pharm`: Functions related to pharmacy information flows and updates

`DatabaseServices_address`: Functions related to address information flows and updates

`DatabaseServices_product`: Functions related to product information flows and updates

`DatabaseServices_order`: Functions related to order information flows and updates

`DatabaseServices_comment`: Functions related to comment information flows and updates

`DatabaseServices_bookmark`: Functions related to bookmark information flows and updates


### Above classes may require and id or list of ids to function. In case of a function belonging to any of above classes but not needing id nor ids, pass an empty string and list to those parameters:

```
DatabaseService_pharm(id:"SwkUgHqGXT65D", ids:[]).pharmdata
//returns a single pharmacy document with given id from Firebase
//as a Stream object 
```

```
DatabaseService_pharm(id:"", ids:["SwkU","gHqGX","T65D"]).pharms
//returns a list of pharmacy documents with given ids from Firebase
//as a Stream object 
```
